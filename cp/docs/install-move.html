      Use these instructions when it is necessary to move your TradeX site to a new server, or to a new account on the same server.  These
      instructions only account for moving your TradeX installation and not any other parts of your site.

      Moving your installation to a new server or a new account on the same server can be accomplished using the following steps:

      <ol>
       <li>Copy the TradeX files from the old server to the new server.  The directory where TradeX is installed on the new server should match
       the directory name on the old server.<br /><br /></li>

       <li>Set the permissions on all files in the data directory to 666 (this includes all files in all sub-folders)<br /><br /></li>

       <li>Set the permissions on all folders in the data directory to 777 (this includes all folders in all sub-folders)<br /><br /></li>

       <li>Login to the TradeX control panel, access the Global Settings interface and save your settings.</li>
      </ol>

      Once these have been done, you should be set to go.
